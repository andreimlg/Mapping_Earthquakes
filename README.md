## Overview of Project:
The purpose of this module was to be able to map information using Leaflet and APIs. Mapping information can have different challenges but through this module it was possible to understand how geographical data is managed. 

This challenge provides the user with a very interactive tool in order to get all the information about earthquakes at a glance.
## Results:
Layers are very useful so the user doesn't get overwhelmed by information is not looking for.

The use of colors are also very helpful when a lot of data points converge in the same area.

## Summary:
There are infinite possibilities to the information that can be shown with the use of visual tools like the one developed here. There's a lot of information in the web and it is a responsibility of Data Analysts to tell the story in an easy way to share knowledge that help jumping to conclusions more easily.
